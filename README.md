# Jets Project - Week 3 Skill Distillery

## Overview
The jet application creates a fleet of jets with different capabilities. The application will be a menu to use the jets and access information about them. During the program startup, it populates the AirField with at least 5 Jets of different types. These jets are read from a text file, where each line in the file contains data for a single Jet object. This file exists at the root of the project and is separated by commas using the String.split(",") method. It populates a menu of options where the user chooses to:
1. List fleet
2. Fly all jets
3. View fastest jet
4. View jet with longest range
5. Load all Cargo Jets
6. Dogfight!
7. Add a jet to Fleet
8. Remove a jet from Fleet
9. Quit
When the user is done, the user presses 9 so it can close out the scanner and exit the system.

## Lessons Learned
I used many concepts of what I learned on week 3. ArrayList, interfaces, abstract, implement, when to implement, how to implement. There was a time when I got stuck implement the interface but later figured out that I needed to create class based on the jettype than the abstract Jet class. Further, paying attention to the detailed instructions helped me reduce the headache which I learned from the FoodTruckApp. I slowly went through each line, tested it to see if it worked, and continued to modify until each menu choice passed the conditions given. Overall, fun project that helped me use the lessons learned from class.
